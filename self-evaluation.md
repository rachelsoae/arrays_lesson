# Self-Evaluation
1. How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
This was a really hard lesson. Of all the content we have covered so far, I feel weakest in this area, but I took notes and have a replit to reference my examples. This was a good brain workout.

2. Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I'd like to work through more examples of each of the methods we used today. I'll have to try to find time to practice that.

3. What questions do you have about Arrays?
What are some examples of context when each of these methods would be useful?
